# What is it?
The future of automation and robotics requires increasing independence from human assistance in the realm of navigation. Our capstoneâ€™s goal with SLAMid is improve how robots autonomously produce labeled datasets of an environment utilizing computer vision with Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) and object identification. We foresee SLAMid applications including disaster response aid in perilous situations, reconnaissance for military missions, and improved navigation for self-driving vehicles.
